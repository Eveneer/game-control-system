# Game Control System

The `game-control-system` package is a TypeScript library that provides a versatile game control system for managing game states, scoring, and options. It is designed to simplify game development by handling essential game control features, such as recording game states, maintaining start, end, and pause states, tracking game scores, and managing game options.

## Installation

You can install the `game-control-system` package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install game-control-system

# or

yarn add game-control-system
```

## Usage

To use the control system in a game, you must first instantiate an object of the `GCS` class with `GCSConstructorObjectType` object as the param.
